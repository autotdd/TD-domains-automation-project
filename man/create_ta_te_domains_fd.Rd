\title{Generate TA and TE Datasets for Factorial Design}
\usage{
create_ta_te_domains_fd(
  study_id,
  trial_design,
  arms_data,
  output_dir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_id}{A character string representing the Study ID.}

\item{trial_design}{A character string representing the trial design. Should be "FACTORIAL DESIGN".}

\item{arms_data}{A list of arm data. Each element in the list should be a list containing \code{armcd}, \code{arm}, \code{epochs}, \code{etcd}, \code{elements}, \code{testrl}, \code{teenrl}, and \code{tedur}.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string representing the output directory. Defaults to the current working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: TA dataset and TE dataset.
}
\description{
This function generates the TA (Trial Arms) and TE (Trial Elements) datasets
for a given study ID based on the FACTORIAL DESIGN.
