\title{Generate TA and TE Datasets for Parallel Design}
\usage{
create_ta_te_domains_pa(
  study_id,
  trial_design,
  arms_data,
  treatments_list,
  te_rules,
  output_dir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_id}{A character string representing the Study ID.}

\item{trial_design}{A character string representing the trial design. Should be "PARALLEL DESIGN".}

\item{arms_data}{A list of arm data. Each element in the list should be a list containing \code{armcd} and \code{epochs}.}

\item{treatments_list}{A list of treatments corresponding to each arm.}

\item{te_rules}{A data frame containing \code{TESTRL}, \code{TEENRL}, and \code{TEDUR} rules.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string representing the output directory. Defaults to the current working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: TA dataset and TE dataset.
}
\description{
This function generates the TA and TE datasets for a given study ID and trial design.
It supports the "PARALLEL DESIGN" trial design.
}
\details{
This function creates the TA (Trial Arms) domain dataset and the TE (Trial Elements) domain dataset, which are part of the SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model).
The function handles the "PARALLEL DESIGN" trial design.
The TA dataset includes columns for study ID, domain, arm codes, epochs, and elements with treatments.
The TE dataset includes columns for study ID, domain, element codes, element descriptions, and rules.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item The \code{arms_data} parameter should be a list of arm data, where each arm includes arm code and epochs.
\item The \code{treatments_list} parameter should be a list of treatments corresponding to each arm.
\item The \code{te_rules} parameter should be a data frame containing \code{TESTRL}, \code{TEENRL}, and \code{TEDUR} rules.
\item The function supports "PARALLEL DESIGN" trials.
