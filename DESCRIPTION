Description: This package streamlines the generation of Trial Design Domains (TA, TE, TI, TS, TV) 
    for clinical trials. It integrates data from ClinicalTrials.gov, PDF protocols, and user-provided 
    information to automate the creation of standardized CDISC SDTM Trial Design domains. This comprehensive 
    approach enhances efficiency, reduces manual errors, and ensures consistency in clinical trial 
    data management and reporting, while accommodating various data sources including PDF protocols.
