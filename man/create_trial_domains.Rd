\usage{
create_trial_domains(
  study_id,
  nct_id,
  trial_design,
  arms_data,
  treatments_list,
  te_rules,
  output_dir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_id}{A character string representing the Study ID.}

\item{nct_id}{A character string representing the NCT ID.}

\item{trial_design}{A character string representing the trial design.
Should be one of "PARALLEL DESIGN", "PARALLEL DESIGN WITH BRANCHES AND TRANSITIONS",
"CROSS-OVER DESIGN", "SINGLE GROUP DESIGN", or "FACTORIAL DESIGN".}

\item{arms_data}{A list of arm data. Each element in the list should be a list containing
\code{armcd}, \code{epochs}, and optionally \code{branch} and \code{trans} for designs that support them.}

\item{treatments_list}{A list of treatments corresponding to each arm.}

\item{te_rules}{A data frame containing TE rules with columns: ELEMENT, TESTRL, TEENRL, TEDUR.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string representing the output directory. Defaults to the current working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing data frames for each created domain (TA, TE, TI, TS).
}
\description{
This function creates multiple trial domains (TA, TE, TI, TS) for a given study.
It combines the functionality of individual domain creation functions into a single workflow.
